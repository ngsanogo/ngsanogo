# 👋 Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm **Issa Sanogo**, a **Data Engineer** in **Paris, France**. I like turning raw data into something teams can trust—clean pipelines, sensible models, and dashboards that speak plainly.

I believe *everything starts with data*, but it only works when people share what they know.

I lean on clear data contracts, reproducible notebooks, and simple metrics so decisions are easy to explain.

Day to day you'll find me in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [SQL](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_Query_Language). When things get messy, I enjoy untangling schemas and naming things well.
