This repository hosts the source files of my website.

To build the website locally, you can clone the repo by typing this line of command in your terminal `git clone https://github.com/ngsanogo/website`.

The website is built via the R package [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). I recommand to read its documentation before using it even if I know you won't do it :).

Don't hesitate to ask if you have any question.
