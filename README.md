# 👋 Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m **Issa Sanogo**, a **Data Engineer / Data Manager** based in **Paris, France**.  
I’m passionate about **data**, from its collection and transformation to its visualization and governance.

I believe that *everything starts with data* — and that the best way to master it is by sharing knowledge and building things.

I’m a big fan of **open source technologies**, especially:  
[R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).

When I’m not exploring new datasets or building pipelines, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new tools, contributing to open projects, or writing about data topics.
