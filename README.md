# My Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0a07735e-6436-49c8-8d27-732f97d9cfed/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ngsanogo/deploys)

This repository hosts the source files of my website.

To build the website locally, you can clone the repo by typing this line of command in your terminal `git clone https://github.com/ngsanogo/website`.

The website is built via the R package [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). I recommand to read its [documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) before using it even if I know you won't do it :).

Don't hesitate to ask if you have any question.
