      <description>The best way to reach me is by email at ngsanogo@gmail.com. You can contact you about anything but if it&amp;rsquo;s about programming, I advise you to post it on Stack Overflow instead. You&amp;rsquo;ll have all the answers you are looking for and even better answer for sure.
The Kamita association hold events every first Saturday of the month. So if you want to meet me, check on the association&amp;rsquo;s website or on assomaliennes.</description>
