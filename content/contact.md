The best way to reach me is by email on [ngsanogo@gmail.com](ngsanogo@gmail.com). But please don't write me for question about programming. If you have question about programming post it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) you'll have many answer and for sure better answer.

The association ([Association Kamita](https://kamita.fr)) organise every first saturday of the month. So if you want to meet me, you can check on the website of the association the place of the next meeting and catch me there. I usually attend.

The only social network I use are : [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/issa-sanogo) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ngsanogo).
