The best way to reach me is by email at [ngsanogo@gmail.com](ngsanogo@gmail.com). You can contact me about anything but if it's about programming, I advise you to post it on <a href= "https://stackoverflow.com/" target = "_blank">Stack Overflow</a> instead. You'll have all the answers you are looking for and even better answer for sure.

The only social networks I use are : [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngsanogo/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ngsanogo).
