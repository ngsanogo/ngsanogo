The best way to reach me is by email at [ngsanogo@gmail.com](ngsanogo@gmail.com). You can contact you about anything but if it's about programming, I advise you to post it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) instead. You'll have all the answers you are looking for and even better answer for sure.

The [Kamita association](https://kamita.fr) hold events every first Saturday of the month. So if you want to meet me, check on the [association's website](https://kamita.fr/evenement) or on [assomaliennes.com](http://assomaliennes.com/evenements) where the next meeting is being held and catch me there.

The only social networks I use are : [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/issa-sanogo) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ngsanogo).
