Get in touch if you have a project in mind. I'd love to discuss about it and find how I can help you.

## Data science

You have a data science project but you don't have the time or expertise to complete? I can help you.
Data analysis is a real passion for me. I can also assist if you want to do your project by yourself and you just need coaching. For instence, I can help you manipulate and merge data sources, build and interpret models, and build predictive and forecasting models etc.

## R packages

You have some code and you would like to turn into an R package? I can work with you to structure, write, document and package your code including getting it through the CRAN submission process. I can also write vignettes for your new (or existing) package to ensure new users can quickly and painlessly get started with your package.

## Shiny apps

You need non-R-users to interact with R code? Are you trying to engage people with interactive and visual interfaces to your data and analysis? I can build [Shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) to provide solutions.

Don't need to talk too much, it means your work and your attitude will speak at your place. So check some of my [work](../projects).
