Get in touch if you have a project in mind. I'd love to discuss about it and figure out how I can help you.

## Data science

You have a data science project but you don't have the time or expertise to complete it? I can help you.
Data analysis is a real passion for me. I can also assist you in doing your project by yourself by setting up coaching sessions. For instence, I can help you manipulate and merge data sources, build and interpret models, and build predictive and forecasting models etc.

## R packages

You have code or codes that you would like to turn into an <a href= "https://www.r-project.org/" target = "_blank">R</a> package? I can work with you to structure, write, document and package your code including getting it through the CRAN submission process; as well as writting vignettes for your new (or existing) package to ensure new users can quickly and easily get started with your package.

## Shiny apps

You need non-R-users to interact with R code? You are trying to engage people with interactive and visual interfaces to your data and analysis? I can build <a href= "https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target = "_blank">Shiny apps</a> to provide solutions.

Old man in <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali" target = "_blank">Mali</a> use to say:

> *Empty barrels make the most noise*

This means: *You don't need to talk too much, your work and your attitude will speak for you. So check out my [work](https://ngsanogo.com/projects) and [contact me](https://ngsanogo.com/contact)*.
