Get in touch if you have a project in mind. I'd love to discuss about it and figure out how I can help you.

## Data science

You have a data science project but you don't have the time or expertise to complete it? I can help you.
Data analysis is a real passion for me. I can also assist you in doing your project by yourself by setting up coaching sessions. For instence, I can help you manipulate and merge data sources, build and interpret models, and build predictive and forecasting models etc.

## R packages

You have code or codes that you would like to turn into an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package? I can work with you to structure, write, document and package your code including getting it through the CRAN submission process; as well as writting vignettes for your new (or existing) package to ensure new users can quickly and easily get started with your package.

## Shiny apps

You need non-R-users to interact with R code? You are trying to engage people with interactive and visual interfaces to your data and analysis? I can build [shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) to provide solutions.

Check out some of my [projects](https://github.com/ngsanogo) and [contact me](https://ngsanogo.rbind.io/contact).
