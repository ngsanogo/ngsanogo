# Hello !

Welcome to my Github account.

My name is Issa Sanogo. I'm a data scientist. I love playing with data.

I'm a big fan of **open source projects** and especially of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
I spend my free time trying new things. I think that the best way to learn is to teach.

For more information about me, feel free to visit [my Website](https://ngsanogo.rbind.io).
